# RaiseUpEntreprenuers
I'm not pulling the ladder up behind me now that I'm where I'm at.  I'm going to turn around and build an elevator to help a long list of people up here!

We've all see the caricature.  The guy that starts a business or career, 'climbs the ladder' to the top, and then pulls the ladder up.  Usually used to bash business owners, or people of a political pursuasion that someone may disagree with, etc.

Naw man.  That's not how it's gonna be.  I want to build a freaking elevator and coach people on how to find and ascend it.  And then I want those people, to do the same for the next generation.

I found and ran an automotive engine management business for 19 years, and just sold that business about a year ago now.  Since then, I've started Smart Ass Products, LLC with the help of a young engineer who worked for me at that prior company (DIYAutoTune/AMPEFI).  

We started the company to bring a product to life that I had dreampt up, but wanted help to turn into a business so that I wasn't doing EVERYTHING, and in the process to help some young wantreprenuer to learn to bring a product/business to life.  So last year, we created [Smart Ass Products](https://smartassproducts.net) and started working to bring one of my product ideas to life.  We call it [The Smart Ass Fuel Mule Motorized Gas Caddy](https://smartassproducts.net/products/smart-ass-fuel-mule) and it's a pretty smart bit of kit if I do say so myself.  Nothing revolutionary, but certainly innovative and incredibly useful particularly in the marine and aviation worlds, as well as construction, farming and agriculture, disaster management, etc.  

Anywhere there is a need to transport and store fuel (gasoline/diesel/kerosene/avgas/jet a), particularly if you need to move it across rough terrain and navigate tight spaces, we've got the market cornered with this device.  And we're patent pending on it.  

I'd like to use this outlet to let people follow along on our journey, with a hope to inspire others that have had some success in business not to hang up their hat yet.... but to teach another how to wear it.

There's a blog series on our website that begins to get into this.  I'll let you use one of the other links above and go to the blog section to check it out.  Creating the World's Best Gas Caddy is the title.  Enjoy.
